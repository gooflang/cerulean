# How to become a contributor and submit your own code

## Patches welcome

Your changes and ideas are welcome and appreciated. Please do not hesitate to ask a question or send a PR.

All changes must be reviewed. We require that all changes get at least one review, preferably from someone familiar with the areas the change touches. For non-trivial changes, we may want two reviewers. In these instances, the primary reviewer should make this decision and nominate a second reviewer. As this is not a corporate sponsored project, please allow for a reasonable time to look at PR, relevant to open issues and pull requests.

Thank you for your contribution(s)!

## Adding a new API endpoint

When adding a new API endpoint, please be sure to include the following:

- [README.md](internal/subscriptions/README.md) - A summation of the api endpoint(s) we're emulating with links to the documentation
- tests - testing is highly valued in this project. Please test at the service level, but also add to the integration test for Cerulean in `tests/`
